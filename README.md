# spotify-clone
This Spotify clone is a front-end web application built with HTML and CSS, replicating the core design and interface of the popular music streaming platform. It features a visually appealing layout with a responsive design that adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes. The homepage includes familiar elements like a navigation sidebar, album covers, song lists, and a playback bar at the bottom, mimicking Spotify's user experience. While the clone focuses on the static aspects, CSS is used extensively for styling, hover effects, and positioning, offering a smooth and intuitive user interface. This project serves as a visual demonstration of Spotify's front-end design using just HTML and CSS.
